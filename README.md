1. First make sure python is installed on your computer. You can either go to the microsoft link or search for it on Microsoft store app. https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-310/9PJPW5LDXLZ5?hl=en-us&gl=US

2. Install the necessary dependencies with the pip command

"pip install pydirectinput"
"pip install pyautogui"

3. In Garry's Mod, Open the console and type  bind - "say /protect" 

4. Execute the script by typing "python protect.py" for Windows or "python protectlinux.py" for Linux and press enter

How it works:

Every 19 minutes the script presses the - key and activates protection. When the autoprotection sequence countdown starts, you will have 20 seconds to tab into the game for the first time. Since the script does not end exactly at 20 minutes, there will be overlap meaning you will be always protected with a buffer of about 40 seconds.


**YOU MUST BE TABBED INTO GMOD FOR THE PROTECTION TO WORK AND PRESS THE KEYBIND**


Photo of the script in action, It's best to use it in conjuction in windowed mode to keep an eye on the timer. Best used when watching long videos, leaving your computer AFK overnight and you want to hog a theater, or you just want to watch a long movie in peace.
